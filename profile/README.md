# What we do

Seon Health strives to democratize mental healthcare with a special emphasis on improving people's interpersonal relationships. We believe that the best way to deliver high-quality mental healthcare is to make top-level clinical expertise more accessible to those who need it the most. To do so, we're building an AI copilot that assesses your individual needs and provides the frameworks, skills and strategies from psychological science that can help you feel more connected in your daily life.
